## Introduction
The lack of accessible tools for segregating waste and finding immediate recycling or reuse solutions leaves individuals unaware of simple steps they can take. Additionally, locating nearby drop-off points for waste types like organic, e-waste, and medical waste remains challenging. The absence of a platform that connects users with disposal facilities and provides instant reuse or recycling ideas inspired us to create a solution for better waste management practices.
### Objective
- Use Traditional ML models, Ensemble models and Deep Learning Models to classify waste images into categories like plastic, metal, or organic categories.
- Provide recycling suggestions, reuse ideas, and safe disposal methods for hazardous or non-recyclable waste.
- Suggest nearby recycling centers or drop-off points using geolocation and mapping tools.
## Research Questions
- Research Question 1: How can image classification models be optimized to accurately categorize waste into distinct categories for better waste management 
  practices?
- Research Question 2: How can location-based services and predictive models be integrated to suggest optimal waste disposal options based on user location and 
  waste type?
